This repository started as a way to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps". It was started on the 1st January 2022 and ran to the 31st March 2022 which is 90 Days! 

What started off as a learning in public project has quickly become a structured way of learning the foundations of DevOps principles, processes and tooling. Maybe you can help contribute some resources you have found useful to the project. 

- DevOps - Written content by myself but then translated and corrected and enhanced by the community 
- DevSecOps - Focus on Security and other topics we did not get to in 2022, Perspectives from communinty subject matter experts. 
- Community Edition - Community Sessions by the community, 91 Sessions shared on YouTube. Different Media with intent to build out resources here as well. 


This will **not cover all things** "DevOps" but it will cover some of the areas that will benefit your learning and understanding overall in this space. The encouragement here is to read & watch the content, be curious, provide feedback and discuss within the community your findings.

The project is not a sponsored operation by any vendors and everything is accessible using free, community and open source software.
