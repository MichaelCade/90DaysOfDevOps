# 90DaysOfDevOps

This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of DevOps. I will be starting this journey on the 1st January 2022 but the idea is that we take 90 days which just so happens to be January 1st to March 31st. 

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources. 

The goal is to take 90 days, 1 hour a day, to tackle over 13 areas of DevOps to a foundational knowledge. 

This will not cover all things DevOps but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
