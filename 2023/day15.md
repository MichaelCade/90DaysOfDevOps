# Container Image Scanning Advanced

## SBOM

**SBOM** stands for **S**oftware **B**ill **O**f **M**aterials.

It is a list of all the components that make up a software application or system.
It includes information about the various third-party libraries, frameworks, and other open-source or proprietary components that are used to build the software.
An SBOM can also include details about the versions of these components, their licensing information, and any known vulnerabilities or security issues.

The objective of an SBOM is to list these components, providing software users visibility over what is included in a software product, and allowing them to avoid components that can be harmful for security or legal reasons.

Usage of SBOMs became more common the past years, after few big supply chain attacks [this](https://www.immuniweb.com/blog/5-biggest-supply-chain-attacks-in-2022-so-far.html) and [last year](https://cyolo.io/blog/top-5-supply-chain-attacks-of-2021/).

In the context of a container image, an SBOM for a container image will contain:

- the Linux packages and libraries installed in the containers
- the language-specific packages installed for the application running in the container (e.g. Python packages, Go packages, etc.)

There are tool that can help you extract the SBOM from a container images.

One such tool is [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft).

For example, we can use syft to generate the SBOM for the `ubuntu:latest` container image:

```console
$ syft ubuntu

We see that the SBOM not only contains the packages and libraries installed inside the container image,
but also list their types and versions.
We can use now cross-reference this list with a vulnerability database to see whether we have any vulnerabilities inside the container.

So what is a **Vulnerability Database**?

## Vulnerability database

A vulnerability database is a collection of information about known vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and other systems.
It typically includes details about the nature of the vulnerability, such as the type of vulnerability, the severity of the vulnerability, and the potential impact of the vulnerability.
A vulnerability database may also include information about how the vulnerability can be exploited, and about any available patches or fixes for the vulnerability.

Some vulnerability databases are [vuldb.com](https://vuldb.com/), [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln), [cvedetails.com](https://www.cvedetails.com/) and [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/).

They provide APIs or raw data that you can download, and cross-reference the packages in our SBOM with the vulnerability information about.
This way, we can find if any of our packages has vulnerabilities that we need to care about.

Usually we can also find information about the library version in which this vulnerability has been introduced and whether it has been fixed in a newer version.
Using this information, we can decide whether to update/downgrade our dependency to mitigate the vulnerability.
As we already established in [Day 14](./day14.md), updating a dependency is not always trivial, because sometimes this update comes with behaviour or API changes.

Another important piece of information about a vulnerability is its **CVSS Score**.

## CVSS

**CVSS** stands for **C**ommon **V**ulnerability **S**coring **S**ystem.

It provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity.
The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low, medium, high, and critical) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their vulnerability management processes.

Basically, one vulnerability can be more severe than another.
We need a system that can objectively rank vulnerabilities based on how easy they are to exploit and how much damage they can cause.

This is where CVSS comes in.

CVSS v3 defines 8 criteria based on which the CVSS score is calculated.
These criteria are:

### Attack Vector

Reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible.

Possible values: **Network(N)**, **Adjacent(A)**, **Local(L)**, **Physical(P)**

### Attack Complexity

Describes the conditions beyond the attacker's control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Possible values: **Low(L)**, **High(H)**

### Priviledges Required

Describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability.

Possible values: **None(N)**, **Low(L)**, **High(H)**

### User Interaction

The requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable component.

Possible values: **None(N)**, **Required(R)**

### Scope

The ability for a vulnerability in one software component to impact resources beyond its means, or privileges.

Possible values: **Unchanged(U)**, **Changed(C)**

### Confidentiality

The impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability.

Possible values: **None(N)**, **Low(L)**, **High(H)**

### Integrity

The impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability.

Possible values: **None(N)**, **Low(L)**, **High(H)**

### Availability

The impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability.

Possible values: **None(N)**, **Low(L)**, **High(H)**

The combination of these 8 vectors determines the CVSS score.
It is between 0 and 10.
0 being the lowest possible, and 10 being the highest (most critical).

[Here](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0) you can find a CVSS calculator, wher you can calculate the score of each vulnerability.
