![](images/day54-01.png)


AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy for developers to host and manage private Git repositories. Think "GitHub but with less features" 🤣 (j/k, see the resource "CodeCommit vs GitHub" for a breakdown) It allows teams to collaborate on code and keep their code securely stored in the cloud, with support for secure access control, encryption, and automatic backups.

With AWS CodeCommit, developers can easily create, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories with powerful code review and workflow tools. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, making it easier to build and deploy applications in a fully automated manner.

Some key features of AWS CodeCommit include:

- Git-based repositories with support for code reviews and pull requests
- Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure access control (this is a big plus)
- Encryption of data at rest and in transit
- Highly scalable and available, with automatic backups and failover capabilities
- Integration with other AWS developer tools like AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild

Overall, AWS CodeCommit is a powerful tool for teams that need to collaborate on code, manage their repositories securely, and streamline their development workflows.
