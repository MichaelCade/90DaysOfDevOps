# This workflow will push and update articles on dev.to each time a new
# commit is pushed to the main branch.
#
# To make it work, you need a dev.to API key, see:
# https://developers.forem.com/api/#section/Authentication/api_key
#
# Once you have generated the token, you need to add them as a secret in your
# GitHub repository:
# - DEVTO_TOKEN: your dev.to API key
# See https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets
# for more information about GitHub secrets.
