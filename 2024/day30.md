Day 30: How GitHub Builds GitHub with GitHub
=========================

Hello!👋

I am April Edwards and I am senior developer advocate at GitHub. I've been at GitHub for almost a year, prior to that I worked for Microsoft. Having spent over 24 years in the tech industry I started my journey in ops and then moved into development. DevOps was a natural fit for me, especially when I started focusing on cloud deployments in 2013. 

In this session I am going to show you how GitHub builds GitHub with GitHub. GitHub is not just a place where resources live, but it's a platform where you can start your DevOps journey, all the way to through to delivering your code.
